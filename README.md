# VL53L1X library for Rust

## Usage

See `examples/scan.rs` for example usage.

## Datasheet

Because ST has not released a datasheet for controlling the VL53L1X and its
various registers, this library is based on the reverse engineering by
[SparkFun](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_VL53L1X_Arduino_Library).

## Platform

This library has only been tested on the Raspberry Pi 3 B+.

## Todo

- [ ] Get/set timing budget.
- [ ] Get/set tuning parameters.
